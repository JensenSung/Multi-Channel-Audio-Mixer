 *
 * GENERAL
 * The aim of this project was to implement an audio mixer that runs on an embedded
 * target and allows for multiple wireless streams to be mixed and outputted.
 * This software was written with the intent to provide a clean, object-oriented,
 * open source approach to the problem at hand.  It runs on the desktop and 
 * arm-based linux environments and utilized the alsa library for device-specific
 * playback.  The client-handling and mixing code was written custom for this project.
 *
*******************************************************************************
 *
 * BUILDING
 * To build this software, there are some dependencies and assumptions that are made.
 * You will need all of the following in order to be able to build this software:
 * >Build System: scons
 * >Libraries: libpthread, librt, libglib-2.0, libasound2
 * >OS: Ubuntu Linux version 10.10 on i386 and 10.04 on pandaboard
 * 
 * In order to build both the audio_mixing_server and audio_client binaries, simply
 * issue the command scons in the root of this code distribution.
 *
*******************************************************************************
 * 
 * RUNNING
 * This software, both audio_mixing_server and audio_client are usable on linux-based 
 * i386 and ARM-based environments. The system running the server will need some sort
 * of network interface available, at least the loopback, in order to work.
 * 
 * Start the server by executing:
 * >./build/audio_mixing_server 
 * 
 * Start a client by executing:
 * >./build/audio_client SOME_WAV_FILE IP_OF_SERVER 22000
 * (ie ./build/audio_client test.wav localhost 22000)
 * (ie ./build/audio_client test.wav 192.168.0.1 22000)
 * 
 * The client will connect to the server and stream audio if it is accessible. 
 * Otherwise, an exception is thrown and a meaningful error printed.
